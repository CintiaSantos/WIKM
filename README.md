## <a name="dec"></a> Project Description

Will It Kill Me (WIKM) is a fully responsive (mobile first) web app that was built in a few days as a full-stack coding project.

This project goal was to help people with food allergies to identify possibly life threatening allergens on the go.

We decided to use machine learning to analyze and classify images of food so we can identify common food allergens in them (with limited accuracy of-course, based on the API model we are using).
You can use this web app to snap a picture with your phone (or upload a picture from your computer) of a dish that's in-front of you, the machine learning API will than analyze the image and return a dynamic graph of the possible ingredients. We than list the possible allergic reaction causing ingredients based on the user food allergies input.
